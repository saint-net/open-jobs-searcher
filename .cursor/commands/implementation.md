# implementation

Imagine a panel of experts reviewing this web scraping and LLM-based job extraction implementation and its logs:

1. **Senior Web Scraping Engineer** — What issues do you see with parsing reliability, selectors, and handling dynamic content?

2. **LLM/Prompt Engineering Specialist** — How would you improve the prompts for data extraction? Are there hallucination risks or token inefficiencies?

3. **Data Engineer** — What about data validation, cleaning, and pipeline robustness?

4. **Log Analysis / Observability Specialist** — What do the logs reveal? What patterns, anomalies, or hidden issues can you identify? Is the logging itself sufficient for debugging?

5. **DevOps/Reliability Engineer** — What about error handling, rate limiting, retries, and failure recovery?

6. **QA Engineer** — How would you test this system? What edge cases are missing? How to detect regressions when website layouts change?

7. **System Architect** — What about scalability, architectural issues, and component coupling? How well will this system grow?

Each expert should provide specific, actionable feedback based on the code and logs provided.
